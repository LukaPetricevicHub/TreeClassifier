# JavaTreeClassifier

## Project Overview

JavaTreeClassifier is a simple decision tree classifier built in Java. It reads data from a CSV file, trains a decision tree model, and evaluates its accuracy. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of machine learning and decision trees.

## Foreword

I built this project as a side project with no specific purpose but to dive a bit into Java and machine learning. It was a great opportunity to learn and explore the basics of decision trees and how to implement them in Java.

## Possible Future Extensions

- **Pruning**: Implement tree pruning techniques to avoid overfitting.
- **Cross-Validation**: Add cross-validation to evaluate the model more robustly.
- **Visualization**: Improve the visualization of the decision tree.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface to interact with the model.
- **Support for Continuous Attributes**: Extend the algorithm to handle continuous attributes.

## Contributions
